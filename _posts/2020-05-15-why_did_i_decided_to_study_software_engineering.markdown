I have always liked stimulating the left side of my brain. In first grade, I discovered chess and I thought it was an amazing game, so that year for my birthday, all I asked for was my very own chess set. In school, subjects like math and science always stood out to me the most. I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in a field that challenges my logic thinking. I also find music very intriguing; I tried a few instruments that didn’t quite fit in with me until I played the guitar for the first time when I was twelve, and I haven’t stopped since. I love creating and learning new things; software engineering is the perfect mix of both, being creative and using logic. I’m two weeks into my program at Flatiron school; I’m loving it and I am very excited to learn more and create more.
